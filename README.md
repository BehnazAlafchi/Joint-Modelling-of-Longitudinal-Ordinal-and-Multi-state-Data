Here, we have provided codes for the joint modeling of an ordinal longitudinal response variable and an illness-death multi-state process. In the codes, it is assumed:
- an explanatory variable in both longitudinal and multi-state sub-models
- the longitudinal variable consists of four categories
- Gauss Hermit Quadrature with 5 points
